how do i ifelse() for 3 conditions instead of just true or false

ChatGPT
In R, when you need to handle more than two conditions with ifelse(), you can nest multiple ifelse() statements. However, this can become cumbersome and difficult to read with many conditions. For three conditions, it's manageable, but for more complex scenarios, you might consider using the case_when() function from the dplyr package, which is more readable and efficient for handling multiple conditions.

Here's how you can use nested ifelse() for three conditions:

R
Copy code
result <- ifelse(condition1, value_if_true1,
                 ifelse(condition2, value_if_true2, value_if_true3))
And here's an example using case_when() from dplyr for the same scenario:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)

result <- data_frame |>
  mutate(new_column = case_when(
    condition1 ~ value_if_true1,
    condition2 ~ value_if_true2,
    TRUE ~ value_if_true3  # Default case
  ))
In these examples:

The nested ifelse() checks condition1 first. If it's true, it returns value_if_true1. If not, it checks condition2. If condition2 is true, it returns value_if_true2. If neither condition1 nor condition2 is true, it returns value_if_true3.
The case_when() function is more straightforward. It checks each condition in turn and returns the corresponding value for the first true condition. The TRUE ~ value_if_true3 line acts as a default or 'else' case, similar to the final argument in nested ifelse() statements.

write some tests for this cleaned data in 

ChatGPT
To write tests for the CSV file you provided, we'll first read the file into a dataframe, then perform various checks to ensure data integrity and correctness. These checks could include:

Verifying Column Names and Types: Ensure the dataframe has the expected columns with the correct data types.
Checking for Missing Values: Identify if there are any missing values in crucial columns.
Validating Age Cohort Values: Ensure that the age_cohort column contains only the expected values.
Testing Age Group Assignment: Verify that the age_group column correctly categorizes based on age_cohort.
Row Count Check: Ensure the file contains an expected number of rows.
I will write some example R code to perform these tests:

R
Copy code
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(testthat)

# Read the data
cleaned_data <- read_csv("/mnt/data/cleaned_data.csv")

# 1. Verifying Column Names and Types
expected_cols <- c("age_cohort", "age_group")
expect_true(all(expected_cols %in% names(cleaned_data)), "Column names mismatch.")

# Checking data types (assuming age_cohort and age_group should be characters)
expect_true(is.character(cleaned_data$age_cohort), "age_cohort is not a character column.")
expect_true(is.character(cleaned_data$age_group), "age_group is not a character column.")

# 2. Checking for Missing Values
expect_true(all(complete.cases(cleaned_data)), "There are missing values in the data.")

# 3. Validating Age Cohort Values
valid_age_cohorts <- c("<18", "18 to 24", "25 to 34", "35 to 44", "45 to 54", "55 to 64", "65+")
expect_true(all(cleaned_data$age_cohort %in% valid_age_cohorts), "Invalid age_cohort values found.")

# 4. Testing Age Group Assignment
# (assuming we have the function to calculate age_group based on age_cohort)
expect_true(all(
  case_when(
    cleaned_data$age_cohort == "<18" ~ "YOUTH",
    cleaned_data$age_cohort == "18 to 24" ~ "YOUNG ADULT",
    TRUE ~ "ADULT"
  ) == cleaned_data$age_group
), "age_group assignment is incorrect.")

# 5. Row Count Check
# (Replace 100 with the expected number of rows)
expect_true(nrow(cleaned_data) == 100, "Row count does not match expected value.")
This code provides a basic framework for testing your CSV file. You can adjust the expected values and conditions according to the specific requirements and characteristics of your data. Additionally, if there are more specific business rules or data integrity constraints relevant to your dataset, you should add tests to cover those as well.
